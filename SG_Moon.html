<h1> Moon Sign</h1>
	<h3> <p>Just as the moon is the force behind the ebbs and flows of our oceans, so does your moon sign push and pull at our internal, emotional seas. Your sun sign is likely how you experience yourself; your thoughts and feelings that others may or may not be externally shared. Your moon sign is determined by your where and when you were born and correlates to the astrological sign that the moon was passing through at the time and place you were born. This means that your moon sign is dependent on the lunar cycle. Your moon sign is the second piece of your Big Three, which is comprised of sun, moon, and rising signs. Learn more about sun and rising signs at the links in the navigation bar above. Find out your moon sign <a href="https://cafeastrology.com/whats-my-moon-sign.html">here</a>. </p>
