<h1> Sun Sign </h1>
	<h3> <p>Just as the sun is the center of our solar system, so is your sun sign the center of your astrological chart around which all other placements revolve. Your sun sign is likely the part of your chart you know the best and is the common answer to, "What's your sign?" and is determined by your birthdate. This means that your sun sign is dependent on what astrological constellation was prominent in the sky on your date of birth. You may or may not strongly identify with the characteristics of this sign, but remember, sun sign is still just one piece of the star chart. This is, however, the first piece of your Big Three, which is comprised of sun, moon, and rising signs. Learn more about moon and rising signs at the links in the navigation bar above. Find out your sun sign <a href="https://cafeastrology.com/whats-my-sun-sign.html">here</a>.</p>
		<p>My sun sign is in Saggittarius, the 9th sign in the astrological order. Saggittarius dates range from November 22nd - December 21st. My birthday is December 8th, 1991 placing me solidly in the center of the sign's season.</p>
