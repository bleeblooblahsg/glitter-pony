<h1> Rising Sign</h1>
	<h3> <p>Determining your rising sign, or ascendant sign, is unique in that it is not correlated with a planet or star per se, but is determined by your time of birth and the correlating constellation that the sun was passing through at that particular time of day. This is why, when astro beleivers like myself want to know your full chart, we not only ask for your date of birth, but also the time and location, as this is how your rising sign is calculated. Rising signs are also unique becasue many astologers have different views on how this placement relates to the rest of the chart as well as how we relate to/come into/grow out of our rising signs throughout our lives. This is the third piece of your Big Three, which is comprised of sun, moon, and rising signs. Learn more about sun and moon signs at the links in the navigation bar above.

	<p>Aries Basics:</p>
		<ul><li>Aries is ruled by the planet Mars</li>
			<li>Aries is the first sign in the astrological year and is the first fire sign, followed by Leo and Saggittarius</li>
			<li>The symbol for Aries is a ram</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Aries Traits:</p>
		<ul><li>Becasue Mars is associated with the Roman god of war, it is perhaps unsurprising that this sign has a reputation for being quick to anger and for being tenacious</li>
		<li>Becuase this is also the baby of the astrological cycle, Aries also has a reputation for crying angry tears and having big emotions, like a baby</li>
		<li>However, being the first sign also means Aries are natural born leaders, often taking control of their own destinies and disliking being compared to or controlled by others</li>
		<li>Aries people have big hearts and are steadfast in their beliefs, like the ram that represents them</li></ul>
